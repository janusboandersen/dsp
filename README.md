# Digital Signal Processing :rocket:
Cases and code from multiple projects and courses (e.g. E3DSB Digital Signalbehandling - digital signal processing, E4DSA Digital Signalanalyse - digital signal analysis):
- Matlab for DSP
- Time and frequency domain analysis of signals and data
- Digital filters
- Transforms: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), z-transform, etc.
- Various filter structures, FIR and IIR design, MA and AR filters
- Real-time system implementation (Texas C55 DSP)
- Stochastic signal processing, noise reduction methods
- etc.

The cases are:
1.1. Time and frequency domain analysis of sound signal (music)
1.2. Analysis of noise using DFT
1.3. Implementation of a filter bank to make an equalizer for sound / music.
1.4. Analysis of ECG data for use in diagnosis, looking at RR-intervals in the time domain and heart-rate-variability (HRV) via the frequency domain (self-driven optional project).
2.1. FSK transmission; Over-the-air transmission of messages using FSK encoding.
2.2. Design and implementation of an IIR notch filter to remove narrow-band noise from a signal. Implementation on a realtime system (Texas DSP C55). 
2.3. Processing of sensor data (from load cell), to handle noise. Analysis of the noise in the frequency domain. Using various types of MA-filters to reduce noise.
2.4. Design and simulation of a sonar system (through the air), using cross-correlation for detection of a frequency modulated signal (FM for pulse compression). Uses various ranging equations to determine object distance. Tests the system under various types of noise and atmospheric filtering.
