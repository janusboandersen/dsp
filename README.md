# Digital Signal Processing :rocket:
Different fun and cool cases of applied DSP and image processing

**The cases**

__DSP__:
- 1.4. Analysis of ECG data for use in diagnosis, looking at RR-intervals in the time domain and heart-rate-variability (HRV) via the frequency domain :heart:
- 1.3. Implementation of a filter bank to make an equalizer for sound / music :speaker:
- 1.2. Analysis of noise using DFT :chart:
- 1.1. Time and frequency domain analysis of sound signal (music).

__More advanced filtering__:
- 2.4. Design and simulation of a sonar system (through the air), using cross-correlation for detection of a frequency modulated signal (FM for pulse compression). Uses various ranging equations to determine object distance. Tests the system under various types of noise and atmospheric filtering. :ship:
- 2.3. Processing of sensor data (from load cell), to handle noise. Analysis of the noise in the frequency domain. Using various types of MA-filters to reduce noise. :balance_scale:
- 2.2. Design and implementation of an IIR notch filter to remove narrow-band noise from a signal. Implementation on a realtime system (Texas DSP C55). :control_knobs:
- 2.1. FSK transmission; Over-the-air transmission of messages using FSK encoding. :pager:
- 2.5. contains slides used for the exam in a second course on DSP.

__Image processing and adaptive filtering__:
- 3.7. 3D Computer vision: Sparse 3D reconstruction and depth-based segmentation. See [here](https://github.com/janusboandersen/3d-computer-vision).
- 3.6. Image segmentation using morphological operations, Laplacians, and watersheds.
- 3.5. Morphological operations on binary images: Erosion, dilation, opening, closing. Use these for noise reduction and region extraction.
- 3.1-3.4. Adaptive filters, LMS, etc. To be uploaded soon.
